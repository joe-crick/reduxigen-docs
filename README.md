## Reduxigen

Reduxigen is a ridiculously simple React state management system that is incredibly robust. 

#### Simple 

Working with state in Reduxigen entails only two concepts:

* State
* Functions

In Reduxigen, as in Redux, your state is a plain JavaScript object.

Reduxigen functions update values in the state---or, more accurately, dispatch actions that create new states.

#### Robust

Reduxigen is built on top of Redux. If you've used Redux, many of the concepts in Reduxigen will be very familiar. However, you'll find using Reduxigen much simpler than Redux. You'll write less code, which will make you more efficient, and less prone to error. At the same time, you'll get all the benefits Redux has to offer.
