# Integration with Existing Redux

## Integration

If you have an existing Redux application, and would like to work with Reduxigen, but don't want to convert all of your existing code--no problem! Reduxigen exposes an `appendReducers` function that achieves something similar to Redux's `combineReducers`. For more information, read the article on `appendReducers`.
